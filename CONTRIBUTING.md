# Contributing to Habitat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Habitat! There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. 

You are currently in the core habitat-operator repo, which is primarily written in Go code and is a Kubernetes controller designed to solve running and auto-managing Habitat Services on Kubernetes. It does this by making use of [`Custom Resource Definition`][crd]s. If you are interested in contributing a new plan to core plans (which is a great way to get started as a new contributor!), check out the [core-plans repo](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans) instead.

If you have questions, join the [Habitat Kubernetes Slack Channel](http://slack.habitat.sh#kubernetes) to talk directly to the community and maintainers. All experience levels of questions are welcome. For general questions regarding Habitat, there is also the general channel.

As a reminder, all participants are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Support Channels

Whether you are a user or contributor, official support channels include:

* GitHub issues: https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat-operator/issues
* Slack: http://slack.habitat.sh

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.

# Feature Requests

To request a change to the way that Habitat works, please [open an issue](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat-operator/issues).

# Bug Reports

Bugs are a reality in software. We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something's a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway. 

If you believe your bug represents a security issue for Habitat users, please follow our instructions for [reporting a security vulnerability.](#report-a-security-vulnerability)

If you have the chance, before reporting a bug please [search existing issues](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat-operator/issues), as it's possible someone has already reported your error.

Opening an issue is as easy as following [this link](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat-operator/issues/new) and filling out the form with as much information as you have. It is not necessary to follow the template exactly.

# Report a security vulnerability

Safety is one of the core principles of Habitat, and to that end, we would like to ensure that Habitat has a secure implementation. Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

All security bugs in the distribution should be reported by email to security@habitat.sh. This list is delivered to a small security team. Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and you'll receive a more detailed response to your email within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

This email address receives a large amount of spam, so be sure to use a descriptive subject line to avoid having your report be missed. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement. 

If you have not received a reply to your email within 48 hours, or have not heard from the security team for the past five days, there are a few steps you can take:

* Contact the current security coordinator (Jamie Winsor) directly.
* Contact the back-up contacts (Fletcher Nichol, Tasha Drew) directly.
* Post on the [slack channel](http://slack.habitat.sh) requesting an update. 

Please note that the discussion forums and slack channel are public areas. When escalating in these venues, please do not discuss your issue. Simply say that you're trying to get a hold of someone from the security team.

# Pull Requests

Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to write Habitat. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using [the Pull Request feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). We use the "fork and pull" model [described here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/), where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository.

Please make pull requests against the `master` branch.

## Signing Your Commits

This project utilizes a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure that each commit was written by the
author or that the author has the appropriate rights necessary to contribute the change.  The project
utilizes [Developer Certificate of Origin, Version 1.1](http://developercertificate.org/)

```

    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

`Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>`

The project requires that the name used is your real name.  Neither anonymous contributors nor those
utilizing pseudonyms will be accepted.

Git makes it easy to add this line to your commit messages.  Make sure the `user.name` and
`user.email` are set in your git configs.  Use `-s` or `--signoff` to add the Signed-off-by line to
the end of the commit message.

## Pull Request Review and Merge Automation

Habitat uses several bots to automate the review and merging of pull requests. Messages to and from the bots are brokered via the account @thesentinel. First, we use Facebook's [mention bot](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot) to identify potential reviewers for a pull request based on the `blame` information in the relevant diff. @thesentinels can also receive
incoming commands from reviewers to approve PRs. These commands are routed to a [homu](https://github.com/barosl/homu) bot that will automatically merge a PR when sufficient reviewers have provided a +1 (or r+ in homu terminology).


## Delegating pull request merge access

A Habitat core maintainer can delegate pull request merge access to a contributor via

	@thesentinels delegate=username

If you've been given approval to merge, you can do so by appending a comment to the pull request containing the following text:

	@thesentinels r+

Note: **do not** click the Merge Pull Request button if it's enabled.
